# Personal-Assistant
Python program to create personal assistant using speech recognition, Google API
and adding a simple UI using tkinter

run GUIBasics.py using python GUIBasics.py

Use requirement.txt to get all required packages (use pip install -r requirements.txt)

enable less secure apps in gmail to send mail(Store mail credentials in UserCreds.py and wolframalpha api details in the same file) 

# How to Install ?
Clone the project and install using pip install -r requirements.txt 

You can also create a virtual environment if you want by following :-
https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
(Make sure you dont use python3.7.6 as it doesnt work well with pyttsx3)
You can use virtualenv -p python3.7.5 [name_of_the_env] - to install virtual env command using a specific python version or use conda create --name [name] python=3.7.5 - to install using conda 

# Motivation 
To create a simple AI Assistant for small repititive tasks by using python libraries and some inbuild function and improving it with time and make use of neural networks. Fun-fact : I have named my AI bot Anchit(which is my real brother's name) cause he never works for me :P

# Functionality :-
1. Wikipedia 
2. Open google 
3. Play music 
4. Change voice 
5. Tell time 
6. email 
7. Speak something 
8. Quit Functionality (goodbye brother)
9. Toss a coin
10. Tell a joke 
11. Calculate (using wolfmalpha api)
12. Simple UI


# To do :-
